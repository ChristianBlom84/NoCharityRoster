<h1>Welcome to the No Charity Roster project!</h1>
<p>This web application is designed to help you manage and maintain a roster of individuals or items that can be benched, as well as provide a way to select individuals from the bench based on specific criteria. Whether you're managing a gaming guild's roster, a work schedule, or any other list, this tool can help streamline the process.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the No Charity Roster, you can simply open the HTML file in your web browser. Here are some of the features and functionality provided by this application:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Display Roster:</strong> The application displays a roster in a tabular format, with columns for Name, Class, Spec, Bench Amount, Decrement, and Delete.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Bench:</strong> You can roll the bench for a specified number of individuals by clicking the "Roll Bench" button. This will select eligible individuals based on the specified criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Reset Bench Counts:</strong> Click the "Reset Bench Counts" button to reset the bench counts for all individuals to zero.</li>
    <li><strong>Add New Entries:</strong> You can add new entries to the roster using the form at the bottom of the page. Fill in the Name, Class, Spec, and Bench fields and click "Submit" to add a new entry to the roster.</li>
    <li><strong>Decrement:</strong> For each individual in the roster, you can decrement their bench count by clicking the "Decrement" button.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can also delete individuals from the roster by clicking the "Delete" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. The roster data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing you to retain your roster even if you close the browser.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>You can customize the application by adjusting the CSS styles in the provided Style.css file. Feel free to modify the styles to fit your preferences and match your website's design.</p>
